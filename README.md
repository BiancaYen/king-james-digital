# King James Digital Assessment

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app has not
been ejected.

In the project directory, first run:

### `yarn install`

To install all NPM dependencies.

Then:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## `yarn json-server`
Run this in unison with the above to create a Restful Server using `json server` on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
